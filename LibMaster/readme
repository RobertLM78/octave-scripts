| User guide                                                                  |

#  General Information  #
#########################
A fork of the classic TI-Extended-BASIC/Myarc-BASIC (TIXB/MXB) program,
LIBRARY-x. This one however introduces some new functions, such as custom file-
names and a record deleting ability (rather than having to overwrite a record).
Also noteworthy is the fact that the search abilities are much more powerful
given the (C-like?) string comparing abilities of OCTAVE.

######################
#  Navigation Notes  #
######################
This is a menu driven script that works on kbhit() - which basically means that
there is no waiting for an ENTER before it does what it is asked.  If a menu
option is selected by accident, to return to the main menu TYPE '<back>' (no
quotes) IF THE INPUT IS supposed to be A STRING, OTHERWISE for NUMERIC INPUT,
TYPE '0' (no quotes).
NOTE: Since there are no input arguments to 'Load File' function (fileLoad.m)
      and therefore no means to create the output arguments, other than to
      reset them, there is no <back> ability.  (Since basically you'd be stuck
      having to use 'Load File' anyway).  No worry, the only thing to lose
      during an accidental visit to 'Load File' is a sort - which is infinitely
      faster here than TIXB/MXB (in fact it is slowed down using 'sleep Xs').

##########################
#  Updating the Catalog  #
##########################
This program no longer relies on a built-in filename, though one still exists.
Enter '<def>' (no quotes) for the default filename (catalog.dat).  Otherwise
enter the name desired, if no path is given, then the path will be the one the
main script was launched from.
Updating is fairly straightforward,  just enter the number of records to add,
then enter the data.  Up to three authors per title may be entered.  The FILE
IS *APPENDED* when finished.

##########################################
#  Sorting Catalog and Deleting Records  #
##########################################
Sorting the catalog will sort by title (TIT), which is the first field of each
record in CAT.  Starting with version 1.1, all preceeding articles are ignored
while sorting, giving a truly alphabetized catalog.dat.  The FILE IS NOT SAVED
when finished.
To delete a record, enter the record number.  That can be found by searching
the title (the last number printed before an item is displayed is the record
number).  The FILE IS NOT SAVED when finished.

####################
#  About Subjects  #
####################
This section of the program will take some adjustments to suite personal needs.
Since this is much more flexible than any previous versions in TIXB/MXB, the
sky is the limit.  By default, a three character system is deployed, for
example:  MUSic, ART, PoeTrY, REFerence.  However anything could be used, as
long as a convention is followed.

#######################
#  General searching  #
#######################
As previously stated, this OCTAVE version of Library Master is much more power-
ful when it comes to searching.  While previously an exact phrase match had to
exist, now one can enter 'calculus' and get all the books with the word
'calculus' in the title.  This does mean however that one has to be careful not
to enter some single word like 'the' without expecting a lot of results!  ;DD

This would be a good project for making an .oct binary.
